# Preparatory work

Before the start of this training week, you should complete the following preparatory work:

## Prepare a presentation on a programming language
For the Tuesday morning, you should prepare (in groups of two) a presentation about a programming language. This should cover:

- Areas where the language is most commonly used
- Pros and cons of the language
- How people typically release software written in the language (making source code available? package managers?)
- Widely used testing frameworks
- Code styling and linting tools
- Other things that are considered good practice when using the language

Who is in each pair and which language they present about is up to you: you should form your group then assign yourself to
one of the sub-issues in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/CCMI-CDT/2025-intake-resources/issues/12). If you wish to talk
about a language that is not yet included, you may add an additional sub-issue.

## Complete the git pre-reading
You should complete the [pre-reading about git](git.md).
